The goal of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is to enable teams to release a constant flow of software updates into production to quicken release cycles, lower costs, and reduce the risks associated with development.
The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
